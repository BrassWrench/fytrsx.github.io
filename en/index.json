[{"content":" Dear sister, See words such as face! It\u0026rsquo;s so boring at the hospital these days. Yesterday I took advantage of the exam to see you, although only for more than an hour, but finally see you. I really enjoyed meeting you for the first time. You look much better than I expected. I started my exam at 4:30 and handed it in at 5:30. I came to you in a hurry. At first, I waited for you at the entrance of the student cafeteria, and then I went to the direction of the library before waiting for you. I thought I would recognize you on the way, but when I got to the library, you told me you were already there, and then I hurried back. The wind was so messy yesterday that it made my hair whirl. Then I saw you between the two doors of the restaurant. It\u0026rsquo;s winter, and you\u0026rsquo;re wearing the beige fleecy coat and beige checkered scarf you showed me, and you\u0026rsquo;re carrying a white bag with a cupcake for me. You\u0026rsquo;re a little shorter than me, so you always look a little cute. Indeed, as you say, you are really like a Southerner \u0026ndash; a \u0026ldquo;little southern potato\u0026rdquo;. This reminds me of something. I thought of a figure squatting on the curb by the school. Then I said hello to you, you saw me, and we went into the restaurant together. What impressed me most about you were your eyes. When I first saw them, I thought they were so beautiful and agile (much bigger than others). But when I really see you, I know, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think wrong. Your features are as delicate as I thought, your hands are more slender than I thought, but your face is a little more sleepy after staying up late for the exam. Then I asked you what you want to eat, you told me you don\u0026rsquo;t often eat here, you like to go to the academy. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you didn\u0026rsquo;t like the students\u0026rsquo; restaurant, or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have brought you here. Confused, you\u0026rsquo;d better say here to eat. We took the elevator to the second floor. You look at the window selling rice on the second floor and don\u0026rsquo;t seem to find anything you like. I followed you, then you told me to let me choose, I went to buy a meal (fish steak, corn and sweet and sour ribs). I brought you chopsticks, you came over, and then you bought a green vegetables and a bowl of rice. I asked you why you ate so little, and then you said you ate a lot for lunch. Then we started chopsticks. Unexpectedly, you began to \u0026ldquo;criticize\u0026rdquo; me, saying why not cherish their own life, waste such a smart brain. I look at you and just smile. I thought, what if I die? Who cares? Then you started telling me about your graduate school life and your advisor. I was just looking at you. I especially like to see you, I like your every expression and action, as if I can never see enough. Then, you looked like you got your hands dirty, and I asked you if you wanted me to buy some tissues, and you said no. Then you go out and wash your hands. I sat in the seat, watching you go back. At that moment, my thoughts were running wild. And when you came back, you brought me a glass of lemonade. You asked me to cool or room temperature, I asked you you like cold or room temperature, you said cold, I took the cup of room temperature. Then we talked about a lot of things, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember, I just remember, I like your voice. There aren\u0026rsquo;t many girls with a natural voice like yours, and you\u0026rsquo;re the most natural and beautiful of them all. After dinner, you said you were going to the library, so I went with you. But I\u0026rsquo;m going back to the hospital soon, so I decided to walk you to the library. You took me around a trail and you said you wanted to smoke. I don\u0026rsquo;t care. You asked me if I want to smoke with you, I said I can\u0026rsquo;t now, I will be found when I go back to smoke, so I will smoke with you after discharge. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a bad habit. I remember many of my favorite female characters smoked, like Lucy from Cyberpunk: Fringe Walker and Powwow from The Chainsaw Man. But you told me that you were under a bit of pressure recently, and I was a bit distressed. There is no one around, I want to hold your hand, but I know I can\u0026rsquo;t. Finally, as we passed the long steps in front of the library, I said I was leaving. You say I am not silly, why want to climb such a long step. I said I wanted to spend more time with you. I look at you, you should be tall for girls, but I still feel you are small - in age and body. Sometimes I even feel like I\u0026rsquo;m bigger than you. There is a moment, I want to hug you, but I still know, I can\u0026rsquo;t. Then I went to see my guide and took me back to the hospital. I bought some snacks at the school gate, and you kept asking me whether I got on the bus. This brings me back to three years ago, when I seemed to keep asking someone if she was on the bus. On the way, I think for a long time, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. Yeah, what should I do? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid you\u0026rsquo;re not my light, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid no one likes me. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;ll pour all my love into you and you won\u0026rsquo;t accept it. I fear that all this is my own fantasy, and finally everything will come to nothing, back to the original zero point. I\u0026rsquo;ve felt that despair many times in the past. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid you would say something completely different to others \u0026ndash; slow down? Independence? I am afraid that I will find out later that I am not the person you need, and when the person you need appears, you will not say such words to him, you just want to be with him quickly, and marry him quickly. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell whether you like me or pity me. I don\u0026rsquo;t need anyone\u0026rsquo;s pity. So sister, if I am not the one you need, please tell me as soon as possible and end my pain. I will walk the road by myself. I don\u0026rsquo;t need anyone\u0026rsquo;s pity, I need is unwavering love. I am writing to wish you well.\nLove you, Xu Xu\n","permalink":"https://www.fytrsx.com/en/posts/letters_to_sister/3/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"font-family: JingLuoTi\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear sister,\n    See words such as face!\n    It\u0026rsquo;s so boring at the hospital these days.

I thought that no one (even if I had tried my best to make it more acceptable) would be able to accept such strong emotional writing, especially not with someone I didn\u0026rsquo;t know very well. However, thank you very much for your acceptance and tolerance, I am such a person, that is the most real me. However, I still have to reflect, I think I should not talk too much about myself in the first letter, this is my shortcoming. I should talk about you and praise you more, or I can only move myself, right? Maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t need those deep, twisted, with deep meaning of expression, you just need to be praised.\nSister, you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. Sister, you have white skin, beautiful features, concave and convex figure, these external conditions do not know how many girls envy, also do not know how many boys love. I can\u0026rsquo;t even understand why your previous partner didn\u0026rsquo;t value you so much. I like your eyes. Your eyes are bigger than many people\u0026rsquo;s. They are gentle on the outside, but they make people feel wisdom and strength behind. I like your nose because it looks tall and straight. I love your lips, their smile is so infectious. I also like your cheek, it is not fat is not thin, like Liu Yifei. In short, my sister\u0026rsquo;s facial features are very handsome, let me see you are a Harbin, if not, I will think you are a girl in the south of the Yangtze River. However, your features are more three-dimensional than theirs \u0026ndash; this is the characteristics of Harbin girls, because you have received the influence of European genes to some extent. But I still find it hard to see someone else smile like you \u0026ndash; so generous, so elegant, so confident. My sister is in good shape. The legs are very long, so that my sister looks very tall, very slender and symmetrical, which reminds me of those gem people in the comic book \u0026ldquo;Gem Country\u0026rdquo;. Moreover, my friends and I both think that my sister\u0026rsquo;s flesh is growing in the right place (this may have something to do with your regular fitness), so it looks bumpy (very material!). . On the whole, I think my sister is more like Raiser in Fujimoto\u0026rsquo;s manga Chainsaw Man, or Miss Marchma. I think my sister would have shown more amazing courage in a suit like Miss Marchmar\u0026rsquo;s.\nOf course, compared to the external image, I care more about your inner charm sister. My sister is a chemistry major, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about chemistry. My research is mostly focused on mathematics, physics and engineering. This reminds me of my high school classmate, who was very fond of chemistry and had several notebooks full of his chemical reactions of various organic substances (he is now studying chemistry in Zhiyuan College of Shanghai Jiaotong University). Probably influenced by the American TV series \u0026ldquo;Breaking Bad\u0026rdquo;, chemistry gives me the feeling that it is a mysterious and powerful subject. I would like to take chemistry courses for you. At the same time, I was able to pass the postgraduate entrance examination from Harbin Normal University to HIT Technology University and get the qualification of joint training, which really makes me admire. My sister is really smart and excellent. Even if I am an undergraduate of HIT, I also have to admire, let me go out to take the postgraduate entrance examination is not necessarily able to be admitted here (of course, my sister should know that I do not have to take the examination ha ha ha). I THINK Harbin NORMAL UNIVERSITY IS also a very excellent school, although I feel more on my side is a lot of beautiful women (as we all know, HIT students take pride in talking about Harbin Normal University objects). Sister, even though I think I\u0026rsquo;m smarter than some people, in front of you, I think I\u0026rsquo;m still a surrender. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the confidence you have, and I can\u0026rsquo;t control my ability well.\nAlthough I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten to know your character better, sister, you are a very nice person. I know my sister is an ENFJ, and people with ENFJ character are naturally full of warmth and leadership. They always exude infectious force and bring encouragement and strength to others with sincerity and care. They are good at understanding the emotions of others and helping those around them to a better future with selfless actions. ENFJ\u0026rsquo;s insight and empathy make them true \u0026ldquo;soul motivators\u0026rdquo;. They not only see the potential in others, but also bring out that potential through their own passion and determination. Their presence makes the world more hopeful and loving. Perhaps, this is the first time my sister is not afraid of me, but pity me. Sister, maybe we have the same capacity for empathy. My sister has her own beliefs, which I think is a good thing. In fact, if I immigrated to Northern Europe one day, I would also convert to Christianity. Sister, one day I will accompany you to the place you want to go, with you to purify our souls. Sister, your gentleness is your biggest advantage, I like it very much, also very grateful.\nSister, I always wanted to rest in hospital for a while in the past time. Away from school, away from the crowd, quiet rest for a while. The hospital was quiet and beautiful to me, and the bustling sounds around gave me a hazy feeling, like an old man watching young children play games. But now that I\u0026rsquo;ve got the chance, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to stay here. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to go out and meet you. The hospital is quiet, but because of you, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be so quiet. When I see the beautiful scenery outside the ward, when I see you a person in the empty classroom, I hate why I have no ability to accompany you. On the one hand, I am afraid that you will forget me. I am afraid that over time, your feelings for me will become weak. I am afraid that other people will appear. You know, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long it will take to meet someone like my sister when I miss the next one. So I want to hold you tight. On the other hand, it may not be painful for you to be alone. But for me, loneliness has been eroding my heart in the past time, so I am afraid of loneliness, so I will not naturally feel that you will also be lonely. I wish I could spend time with you. However, I am also telling myself that you are you, I am me, you are not afraid of loneliness, you will prefer me to take medicine in the hospital, take good health before coming out. Therefore, I will still take my medicine and listen to the doctor and the school. And sister, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you like me to say \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes I feel like the words come out empty, like I\u0026rsquo;m Shouting into a cave. If my sister doesn\u0026rsquo;t like it, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to say.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to end with a quote from Herman Hesse\u0026rsquo;s novel Siddhartha: \u0026ldquo;How beautiful and charming the world is when one is simple, awake, and unhesitatingly absorbed in walking through it.\u0026rdquo; Sister, the exam went well, I hope we can all become better. Besides, I will keep the promise I made to my sister.\nI am writing to wish you well.\nLove you, Xu Xu\n","permalink":"https://www.fytrsx.com/en/posts/letters_to_sister/2/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"font-family: JingLuoTi\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear sister,\u003cbr\u003e\n    See words such as face!\u003cbr\u003e\n    I\u0026rsquo;m glad you liked what I wrote to you!

In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I last wrote a letter to someone, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t expressed my feelings through words for a long time. Sometimes, I suspect that my brain has been stuck and I can\u0026rsquo;t communicate with people properly. But what I am sure of is that I have many things to say to you. I want to show you my past, my present and my future. Over the past few days, they\u0026rsquo;ve been running through my mind, and I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write them down. To this day, I still think that writing a letter is the most romantic thing in the world, so let it be a carrier and put my love here.\nBefore you came, I went through a long, very dark time. It was a miracle that we met, at least in my eyes. As you know, I have bipolar disorder. The day I met you, I was so desperate that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even find the motivation to live, so I tried to kill myself by taking medicine in the dormitory. Fifty pills of lithium carbonate landed me in the intensive care unit of Weihai Municipal Hospital. It is also that day, I pay close attention to a girl gave me back, which is basically impossible in my eyes, of course, she is you. So I started to get to know you, only to know that you are two years older than me, is HIT chemistry master, and you will soon return to the headquarters. When I was in the ICU, I missed you the most. I wanted to come out earlier and talk to you more, even if we didn\u0026rsquo;t say a few words at that time. I\u0026rsquo;ve been wondering, is the person I\u0026rsquo;ve been praying for night and night for over a year finally coming? After torturing me for so long, is God finally willing to give me a chance to change my ways?\nI was afraid to let you know about my suicide. I was afraid to scare you away. I was afraid that I would be rejected again. But later, I found that you did not dislike me. You told me about your past, your beliefs, your personality and your graduate school life. Most importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in a hurry to reject me. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry sister, maybe in the past period of time, I have been too short of love, so I see you, like a straw to cling to. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, I know this is my psychological problem, I always want to be quick, quick to determine something, let my anxious heart can settle down a little, but I know, this will hurt you, it is disrespectful to you.\nBipolar disorder is a horrible condition, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always known that. In my interactions with outsiders, I have been trying to hide my extremely unstable emotional core. I\u0026rsquo;m still as afraid as ever that you will leave me. INFP personality and avoidant attachment can make me angry over small things, push you away and then regret it, then push you away again. I know myself so well that when I get attached to someone or something, my ability to self-destruct will destroy all the good things in a whirlwind cloud, shatter all my plans, and leave me alone in the ruins. I will also worry about some uncertain outcome in the future, and even stress in advance. When I see no hope, I would rather walk away, so as to avoid my heart is completely broken, I am too afraid of hurt. It reminds me of someone. I am always pessimistic about the future, and pessimistic about the people around me. I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to feel any love anymore. I do not know, the elder sister later will dislike me?\nIn fact, this letter is full of my shortcomings and self-analysis. I even worried that you might think I was too heavy. But believe me, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to be a better person, too. I\u0026rsquo;m actually afraid to tell you these things. I\u0026rsquo;d rather be able to write something positive. In fact, no one likes a person who spreads negative feelings every day, right? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that I\u0026rsquo;m putting too much pressure on you, or that I\u0026rsquo;m demanding too much of you, and that you\u0026rsquo;re tired. So, I try to tell myself, don\u0026rsquo;t be greedy, be grateful. My love will also bring pressure to you, I know that, so I have to learn to tolerate more. However, I am a very smart person, and I can still use my IQ to bring you some practical help.\nSister, I once felt that I was a person who could not be loved, and that I could not give real love to others. But you came along and made me rethink everything. Maybe love is not to take from others, but to give and cherish, like the narrow door \u0026ndash; it is the way to holiness, but it always requires patience and sacrifice. I dare not ask too much, only hope that you can occasionally give me a little response, even if only a brief greeting, can become my strength against the pain in my heart. As Dostoyevsky wrote in The Brothers Karamazov: \u0026ldquo;Even if I can\u0026rsquo;t see the sun, I know it exists. To know that the sun exists is the whole of life.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if my sister is the one I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you can accompany me to the end. But I don\u0026rsquo;t care anymore. I am afraid to give you pressure, so I will not identify you so, I am willing to leave the pain to their own. My sister can leave me at any time. However, I sincerely pray to God that you will accompany me to take a few more steps, just a few steps, because I do not have the ability to experience emotional setbacks. If God thinks I am unworthy of her presence, take me to Northern Europe at last, and I will end it there, for I cannot be saved.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;m Jerome from The Narrow Door. He said, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t find any meaning in my life except love, so I hold on to it. I wait for nothing, and will not wait, but for my lover to come.\u0026rdquo; Like him, I can\u0026rsquo;t focus my energy on anyone other than my lover. In my eyes, there are only two things worth looking forward to in life: the company of my lover and the career I love. The former is more important than the latter.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t express my emotions very well. Please don\u0026rsquo;t misunderstand my meaning, please don\u0026rsquo;t dislike me, I am also learning to accept myself. But sister, thank you for your tolerance and patience, thank you for giving me these beautiful moments. Even if the road ahead bumpy, I will be careful to take care of this precious feelings. If this feeling will fade, I would like to cherish it in the depths of memory with a grateful heart.\nFinally, I would like to end with a quote from Gide: \u0026ldquo;Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for the wide gate and the wide road lead to destruction, and there are many who enter; But narrow gates and narrow passages lead to eternal life, which few can find.\u0026rdquo; I hope that no matter what the future holds, we can all become better selves.\nI am writing to wish you well.\nA man in the dark waiting for the dawn\n","permalink":"https://www.fytrsx.com/en/posts/letters_to_sister/1/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"font-family: JingLuoTi\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear sister,\u003cbr\u003e\n    See words such as face!\u003cbr\u003e\n    I thought long and hard about how to begin this letter, how to begin this first sentence. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I last wrote a letter to someone, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t expressed my feelings through words for a long time. Sometimes, I suspect that my brain has been stuck and I can\u0026rsquo;t communicate with people properly. But what I am sure of is that I have many things to say to you. I want to show you my past, my present and my future. Over the past few days, they\u0026rsquo;ve been running through my mind, and I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write them down. To this day, I still think that writing a letter is the most romantic thing in the world, so let it be a carrier and put my love here.\u003cbr\u003e\n    Before you came, I went through a long, very dark time. It was a miracle that we met, at least in my eyes. As you know, I have bipolar disorder. The day I met you, I was so desperate that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even find the motivation to live, so I tried to kill myself by taking medicine in the dormitory. Fifty pills of lithium carbonate landed me in the intensive care unit of Weihai Municipal Hospital. It is also that day, I pay close attention to a girl gave me back, which is basically impossible in my eyes, of course, she is you. So I started to get to know you, only to know that you are two years older than me, is HIT chemistry master, and you will soon return to the headquarters.
