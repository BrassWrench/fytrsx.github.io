  "articleBody": " Dear sister,\nSee words such as face!\nI thought long and hard about how to begin this letter, how to begin this first sentence. In fact, it’s been a long time since I last wrote a letter to someone, and I haven’t expressed my feelings through words for a long time. Sometimes, I suspect that my brain has been stuck and I can’t communicate with people properly. But what I am sure of is that I have many things to say to you. I want to show you my past, my present and my future. Over the past few days, they’ve been running through my mind, and I thought I’d write them down. To this day, I still think that writing a letter is the most romantic thing in the world, so let it be a carrier and put my love here.\nBefore you came, I went through a long, very dark time. It was a miracle that we met, at least in my eyes. As you know, I have bipolar disorder. The day I met you, I was so desperate that I couldn’t even find the motivation to live, so I tried to kill myself by taking medicine in the dormitory. Fifty pills of lithium carbonate landed me in the intensive care unit of Weihai Municipal Hospital. It is also that day, I pay close attention to a girl gave me back, which is basically impossible in my eyes, of course, she is you. So I started to get to know you, only to know that you are two years older than me, is HIT chemistry master, and you will soon return to the headquarters. When I was in the ICU, I missed you the most. I wanted to come out earlier and talk to you more, even if we didn’t say a few words at that time. I’ve been wondering, is the person I’ve been praying for night and night for over a year finally coming? After torturing me for so long, is God finally willing to give me a chance to change my ways?\nI was afraid to let you know about my suicide. I was afraid to scare you away. I was afraid that I would be rejected again. But later, I found that you did not dislike me. You told me about your past, your beliefs, your personality and your graduate school life. Most importantly, you don’t seem to be in a hurry to reject me. I’m sorry sister, maybe in the past period of time, I have been too short of love, so I see you, like a straw to cling to. I’m sorry, I know this is my psychological problem, I always want to be quick, quick to determine something, let my anxious heart can settle down a little, but I know, this will hurt you, it is disrespectful to you.\nBipolar disorder is a horrible condition, and I’ve always known that. In my interactions with outsiders, I have been trying to hide my extremely unstable emotional core. I’m still as afraid as ever that you will leave me. INFP personality and avoidant attachment can make me angry over small things, push you away and then regret it, then push you away again. I know myself so well that when I get attached to someone or something, my ability to self-destruct will destroy all the good things in a whirlwind cloud, shatter all my plans, and leave me alone in the ruins. I will also worry about some uncertain outcome in the future, and even stress in advance. When I see no hope, I would rather walk away, so as to avoid my heart is completely broken, I am too afraid of hurt. It reminds me of someone. I am always pessimistic about the future, and pessimistic about the people around me. I don’t seem to feel any love anymore. I do not know, the elder sister later will dislike me?\nIn fact, this letter is full of my shortcomings and self-analysis. I even worried that you might think I was too heavy. But believe me, I’m trying to be a better person, too. I’m actually afraid to tell you these things. I’d rather be able to write something positive. In fact, no one likes a person who spreads negative feelings every day, right? I’m afraid that I’m putting too much pressure on you, or that I’m demanding too much of you, and that you’re tired. So, I try to tell myself, don’t be greedy, be grateful. My love will also bring pressure to you, I know that, so I have to learn to tolerate more. However, I am a very smart person, and I can still use my IQ to bring you some practical help.\nSister, I once felt that I was a person who could not be loved, and that I could not give real love to others. But you came along and made me rethink everything. Maybe love is not to take from others, but to give and cherish, like the narrow door – it is the way to holiness, but it always requires patience and sacrifice. I dare not ask too much, only hope that you can occasionally give me a little response, even if only a brief greeting, can become my strength against the pain in my heart. As Dostoyevsky wrote in The Brothers Karamazov: “Even if I can’t see the sun, I know it exists. To know that the sun exists is the whole of life.”\nI don’t know if my sister is the one I’m looking for. I don’t know if you can accompany me to the end. But I don’t care anymore. I am afraid to give you pressure, so I will not identify you so, I am willing to leave the pain to their own. My sister can leave me at any time. However, I sincerely pray to God that you will accompany me to take a few more steps, just a few steps, because I do not have the ability to experience emotional setbacks. If God thinks I am unworthy of her presence, take me to Northern Europe at last, and I will end it there, for I cannot be saved.\nMaybe I’m Jerome from The Narrow Door. He said, “I can’t find any meaning in my life except love, so I hold on to it. I wait for nothing, and will not wait, but for my lover to come.” Like him, I can’t focus my energy on anyone other than my lover. In my eyes, there are only two things worth looking forward to in life: the company of my lover and the career I love. The former is more important than the latter.\nI can’t express my emotions very well. Please don’t misunderstand my meaning, please don’t dislike me, I am also learning to accept myself. But sister, thank you for your tolerance and patience, thank you for giving me these beautiful moments. Even if the road ahead bumpy, I will be careful to take care of this precious feelings. If this feeling will fade, I would like to cherish it in the depths of memory with a grateful heart.\nFinally, I would like to end with a quote from Gide: “Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for the wide gate and the wide road lead to destruction, and there are many who enter; But narrow gates and narrow passages lead to eternal life, which few can find.” I hope that no matter what the future holds, we can all become better selves.\nI am writing to wish you well.\nA man in the dark waiting for the dawn\n",

<p>Dear sister,<br>
    See words such as face!<br>
    I thought long and hard about how to begin this letter, how to begin this first sentence. In fact, it&rsquo;s been a long time since I last wrote a letter to someone, and I haven&rsquo;t expressed my feelings through words for a long time. Sometimes, I suspect that my brain has been stuck and I can&rsquo;t communicate with people properly. But what I am sure of is that I have many things to say to you.

The day I met you, I was so desperate that I couldn&rsquo;t even find the motivation to live, so I tried to kill myself by taking medicine in the dormitory.

It is also that day, I pay close attention to a girl gave me back, which is basically impossible in my eyes, of course, she is you.

When I was in the ICU, I missed you the most. I wanted to come out earlier and talk to you more, even if we didn&rsquo;t say a few words at that time. I&rsquo;ve been wondering, is the person I&rsquo;ve been praying for night and night for over a year finally coming?

I&rsquo;m sorry sister, maybe in the past period of time, I have been too short of love, so I see you, like a straw to cling to. I&rsquo;m sorry, I know this is my psychological problem, I always want to be quick, quick to determine something, let my anxious heart can settle down a little, but I know, this will hurt you, it is disrespectful to you.<br>
    Bipolar disorder is a horrible condition, and I&rsquo;ve always known that. In my interactions with outsiders, I have been trying to hide my extremely unstable emotional core. I&rsquo;m still as afraid as ever that you will leave me. INFP personality and avoidant attachment can make me angry over small things, push you away and then regret it, then push you away again. I know myself so well that when I get attached to someone or something, my ability to self-destruct will destroy all the good things in a whirlwind cloud, shatter all my plans, and leave me alone in the ruins. I will also worry about some uncertain outcome in the future, and even stress in advance. When I see no hope, I would rather walk away, so as to avoid my heart is completely broken, I am too afraid of hurt. It reminds me of someone. I am always pessimistic about the future, and pessimistic about the people around me. I don&rsquo;t seem to feel any love anymore. I do not know, the elder sister later will dislike me?<br>
    In fact, this letter is full of my shortcomings and self-analysis. I even worried that you might think I was too heavy. But believe me, I&rsquo;m trying to be a better person, too. I&rsquo;m actually afraid to tell you these things. I&rsquo;d rather be able to write something positive. In fact, no one likes a person who spreads negative feelings every day, right? I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m putting too much pressure on you, or that I&rsquo;m demanding too much of you, and that you&rsquo;re tired.

Maybe love is not to take from others, but to give and cherish, like the narrow door &ndash; it is the way to holiness, but it always requires patience and sacrifice.

However, I sincerely pray to God that you will accompany me to take a few more steps, just a few steps, because I do not have the ability to experience emotional setbacks.

    Finally, I would like to end with a quote from Gide: &ldquo;Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for the wide gate and the wide road lead to destruction, and there are many who enter; But narrow gates and narrow passages lead to eternal life, which few can find.&rdquo; I hope that no matter what the future holds, we can all become better selves.<br>
    I am writing to wish you well.</p>
