  "articleBody": " Dear sister,\nSee words such as face!\nIt’s so boring at the hospital these days. Yesterday I took advantage of the exam to see you, although only for more than an hour, but finally see you. I really enjoyed meeting you for the first time. You look much better than I expected. I started my exam at 4:30 and handed it in at 5:30. I came to you in a hurry. At first, I waited for you at the entrance of the student cafeteria, and then I went to the direction of the library before waiting for you. I thought I would recognize you on the way, but when I got to the library, you told me you were already there, and then I hurried back. The wind was so messy yesterday that it made my hair whirl. Then I saw you between the two doors of the restaurant. It’s winter, and you’re wearing the beige fleecy coat and beige checkered scarf you showed me, and you’re carrying a white bag with a cupcake for me. You’re a little shorter than me, so you always look a little cute. Indeed, as you say, you are really like a Southerner – a “little southern potato”.\nThis reminds me of something. I thought of a figure squatting on the curb by the school.\nThen I said hello to you, you saw me, and we went into the restaurant together. What impressed me most about you were your eyes. When I first saw them, I thought they were so beautiful and agile (much bigger than others). But when I really see you, I know, I didn’t think wrong. Your features are as delicate as I thought, your hands are more slender than I thought, but your face is a little more sleepy after staying up late for the exam. Then I asked you what you want to eat, you told me you don’t often eat here, you like to go to the academy. I didn’t know you didn’t like the students’ restaurant, or I wouldn’t have brought you here. Confused, you’d better say here to eat. We took the elevator to the second floor. You look at the window selling rice on the second floor and don’t seem to find anything you like. I followed you, then you told me to let me choose, I went to buy a meal (fish steak, corn and sweet and sour ribs). I brought you chopsticks, you came over, and then you bought a green vegetables and a bowl of rice. I asked you why you ate so little, and then you said you ate a lot for lunch. Then we started chopsticks.\nUnexpectedly, you began to “criticize” me, saying why not cherish their own life, waste such a smart brain. I look at you and just smile. I thought, what if I die? Who cares? Then you started telling me about your graduate school life and your advisor. I was just looking at you. I especially like to see you, I like your every expression and action, as if I can never see enough. Then, you looked like you got your hands dirty, and I asked you if you wanted me to buy some tissues, and you said no. Then you go out and wash your hands. I sat in the seat, watching you go back.\nAt that moment, my thoughts were running wild.\nAnd when you came back, you brought me a glass of lemonade. You asked me to cool or room temperature, I asked you you like cold or room temperature, you said cold, I took the cup of room temperature. Then we talked about a lot of things, I can’t remember, I just remember, I like your voice. There aren’t many girls with a natural voice like yours, and you’re the most natural and beautiful of them all. After dinner, you said you were going to the library, so I went with you. But I’m going back to the hospital soon, so I decided to walk you to the library. You took me around a trail and you said you wanted to smoke. I don’t care. You asked me if I want to smoke with you, I said I can’t now, I will be found when I go back to smoke, so I will smoke with you after discharge. I don’t think it’s a bad habit. I remember many of my favorite female characters smoked, like Lucy from Cyberpunk: Fringe Walker and Powwow from The Chainsaw Man. But you told me that you were under a bit of pressure recently, and I was a bit distressed. There is no one around, I want to hold your hand, but I know I can’t. Finally, as we passed the long steps in front of the library, I said I was leaving. You say I am not silly, why want to climb such a long step. I said I wanted to spend more time with you. I look at you, you should be tall for girls, but I still feel you are small - in age and body. Sometimes I even feel like I’m bigger than you. There is a moment, I want to hug you, but I still know, I can’t.\nYeah, what should I do? I’m afraid you’re not my light, I’m afraid no one likes me. I’m afraid I’ll pour all my love into you and you won’t accept it. I fear that all this is my own fantasy, and finally everything will come to nothing, back to the original zero point. I’ve felt that despair many times in the past. I’m afraid you would say something completely different to others – slow down? Independence? I am afraid that I will find out later that I am not the person you need, and when the person you need appears, you will not say such words to him, you just want to be with him quickly, and marry him quickly. Actually, when you were with your second partner, you didn’t say that to him, did you? Well, maybe you don’t have any of these defenses. You just don’t think I’m a good fit. Perhaps, I can always see the essence of things, to prevent myself from falling into the abyss of conjecture. I can’t tell whether you like me or pity me, but I don’t need anyone’s pity. So sister, if you don’t want to choose me, please tell me as soon as possible and end my pain. I will walk the road by myself. I don’t need anyone’s pity, I need is unwavering love.\nI am writing to wish you well.\nLove you, Xu Xu\n",

<p>Dear sister,<br>

I really enjoyed meeting you for the first time. You look much better than I expected. I started my exam at 4:30 and handed it in at 5:30. I came to you in a hurry.
