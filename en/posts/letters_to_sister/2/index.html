  "articleBody": " Dear sister,\nSee words such as face!\nI’m glad you liked what I wrote to you! I thought that no one (even if I had tried my best to make it more acceptable) would be able to accept such strong emotional writing, especially not with someone I didn’t know very well. However, thank you very much for your acceptance and tolerance, I am such a person, that is the most real me. However, I still have to reflect, I think I should not talk too much about myself in the first letter, this is my shortcoming. I should talk about you and praise you more, or I can only move myself, right? Maybe you don’t need those deep, twisted, with deep meaning of expression, you just need to be praised.\nSister, you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. Sister, you have white skin, beautiful features, concave and convex figure, these external conditions do not know how many girls envy, also do not know how many boys love. I can’t even understand why your previous partner didn’t value you so much. I like your eyes. Your eyes are bigger than many people’s. They are gentle on the outside, but they make people feel wisdom and strength behind. I like your nose because it looks tall and straight. I love your lips, their smile is so infectious. I also like your cheek, it is not fat is not thin, like Liu Yifei. In short, my sister’s facial features are very handsome, let me see you are a Harbin, if not, I will think you are a girl in the south of the Yangtze River. However, your features are more three-dimensional than theirs – this is the characteristics of Harbin girls, because you have received the influence of European genes to some extent. But I still find it hard to see someone else smile like you – so generous, so elegant, so confident. My sister is in good shape. The legs are very long, so that my sister looks very tall, very slender and symmetrical, which reminds me of those gem people in the comic book “Gem Country”. Moreover, my friends and I both think that my sister’s flesh is growing in the right place (this may have something to do with your regular fitness), so it looks bumpy (very material!). . On the whole, I think my sister is more like Raiser in Fujimoto’s manga Chainsaw Man, or Miss Marchma. I think my sister would have shown more amazing courage in a suit like Miss Marchmar’s.\nOf course, compared to the external image, I care more about your inner charm sister. My sister is a chemistry major, but I don’t know much about chemistry. My research is mostly focused on mathematics, physics and engineering. This reminds me of my high school classmate, who was very fond of chemistry and had several notebooks full of his chemical reactions of various organic substances (he is now studying chemistry in Zhiyuan College of Shanghai Jiaotong University). Probably influenced by the American TV series “Breaking Bad”, chemistry gives me the feeling that it is a mysterious and powerful subject. I would like to take chemistry courses for you. At the same time, I was able to pass the postgraduate entrance examination from Harbin Normal University to HIT Technology University and get the qualification of joint training, which really makes me admire. My sister is really smart and excellent. Even if I am an undergraduate of HIT, I also have to admire, let me go out to take the postgraduate entrance examination is not necessarily able to be admitted here (of course, my sister should know that I do not have to take the examination ha ha ha). I THINK Harbin NORMAL UNIVERSITY IS also a very excellent school, although I feel more on my side is a lot of beautiful women (as we all know, HIT students take pride in talking about Harbin Normal University objects). Sister, even though I think I’m smarter than some people, in front of you, I think I’m still a surrender. I don’t have the confidence you have, and I can’t control my ability well.\nAlthough I haven’t gotten to know your character better, sister, you are a very nice person. I know my sister is an ENFJ, and people with ENFJ character are naturally full of warmth and leadership. They always exude infectious force and bring encouragement and strength to others with sincerity and care. They are good at understanding the emotions of others and helping those around them to a better future with selfless actions. ENFJ’s insight and empathy make them true “soul motivators”. They not only see the potential in others, but also bring out that potential through their own passion and determination. Their presence makes the world more hopeful and loving. Perhaps, this is the first time my sister is not afraid of me, but pity me. Sister, maybe we have the same capacity for empathy. My sister has her own beliefs, which I think is a good thing. In fact, if I immigrated to Northern Europe one day, I would also convert to Christianity. Sister, one day I will accompany you to the place you want to go, with you to purify our souls. Sister, your gentleness is your biggest advantage, I like it very much, also very grateful.\nSister, I always wanted to rest in hospital for a while in the past time. Away from school, away from the crowd, quiet rest for a while. The hospital was quiet and beautiful to me, and the bustling sounds around gave me a hazy feeling, like an old man watching young children play games. But now that I’ve got the chance, I don’t want to stay here. I can’t wait to go out and meet you. The hospital is quiet, but because of you, I don’t want to be so quiet. When I see the beautiful scenery outside the ward, when I see you a person in the empty classroom, I hate why I have no ability to accompany you. On the one hand, I am afraid that you will forget me. I am afraid that over time, your feelings for me will become weak. I am afraid that other people will appear. You know, I don’t know how long it will take to meet someone like my sister when I miss the next one. So I want to hold you tight. On the other hand, it may not be painful for you to be alone. But for me, loneliness has been eroding my heart in the past time, so I am afraid of loneliness, so I will not naturally feel that you will also be lonely. I wish I could spend time with you. However, I am also telling myself that you are you, I am me, you are not afraid of loneliness, you will prefer me to take medicine in the hospital, take good health before coming out. Therefore, I will still take my medicine and listen to the doctor and the school. And sister, I don’t know if you like me to say “I love you”. Sometimes I feel like the words come out empty, like I’m Shouting into a cave. If my sister doesn’t like it, I don’t have to say.\nI’d like to end with a quote from Herman Hesse’s novel Siddhartha: “How beautiful and charming the world is when one is simple, awake, and unhesitatingly absorbed in walking through it.” Sister, the exam went well, I hope we can all become better. Besides, I will keep the promise I made to my sister.\nI am writing to wish you well.\nLove you, Xu Xu\n",

<p>Dear sister,<br>
    See words such as face!<br>
    I&rsquo;m glad you liked what I wrote to you! I thought that no one (even if I had tried my best to make it more acceptable) would be able to accept such strong emotional writing, especially not with someone I didn&rsquo;t know very well. However, thank you very much for your acceptance and tolerance, I am such a person, that is the most real me.

I should talk about you and praise you more, or I can only move myself, right? Maybe you don&rsquo;t need those deep, twisted, with deep meaning of expression, you just need to be praised.<br>
    Sister, you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. Sister, you have white skin, beautiful features, concave and convex figure, these external conditions do not know how many girls envy, also do not know how many boys love. I can&rsquo;t even understand why your previous partner didn&rsquo;t value you so much. I like your eyes. Your eyes are bigger than many people&rsquo;s. They are gentle on the outside, but they make people feel wisdom and strength behind. I like your nose because it looks tall and straight. I love your lips, their smile is so infectious. I also like your cheek, it is not fat is not thin, like Liu Yifei. In short, my sister&rsquo;s facial features are very handsome, let me see you are a Harbin, if not, I will think you are a girl in the south of the Yangtze River. However, your features are more three-dimensional than theirs &ndash; this is the characteristics of Harbin girls, because you have received the influence of European genes to some extent. But I still find it hard to see someone else smile like you &ndash; so generous, so elegant, so confident. My sister is in good shape. The legs are very long, so that my sister looks very tall, very slender and symmetrical, which reminds me of those gem people in the comic book &ldquo;Gem Country&rdquo;. Moreover, my friends and I both think that my sister&rsquo;s flesh is growing in the right place (this may have something to do with your regular fitness), so it looks bumpy (very material!). . On the whole, I think my sister is more like Raiser in Fujimoto&rsquo;s manga Chainsaw Man, or Miss Marchma. I think my sister would have shown more amazing courage in a suit like Miss Marchmar&rsquo;s.<br>
    Of course, compared to the external image, I care more about your inner charm sister. My sister is a chemistry major, but I don&rsquo;t know much about chemistry. My research is mostly focused on mathematics, physics and engineering. This reminds me of my high school classmate, who was very fond of chemistry and had several notebooks full of his chemical reactions of various organic substances (he is now studying chemistry in Zhiyuan College of Shanghai Jiaotong University). Probably influenced by the American TV series &ldquo;Breaking Bad&rdquo;, chemistry gives me the feeling that it is a mysterious and powerful subject. I would like to take chemistry courses for you. At the same time, I was able to pass the postgraduate entrance examination from Harbin Normal University to HIT Technology University and get the qualification of joint training, which really makes me admire.

I don&rsquo;t have the confidence you have, and I can&rsquo;t control my ability well.<br>
    Although I haven&rsquo;t gotten to know your character better, sister, you are a very nice person. I know my sister is an ENFJ, and people with ENFJ character are naturally full of warmth and leadership. They always exude infectious force and bring encouragement and strength to others with sincerity and care. They are good at understanding the emotions of others and helping those around them to a better future with selfless actions. ENFJ&rsquo;s insight and empathy make them true &ldquo;soul motivators&rdquo;. They not only see the potential in others, but also bring out that potential through their own passion and determination. Their presence makes the world more hopeful and loving. Perhaps, this is the first time my sister is not afraid of me, but pity me. Sister, maybe we have the same capacity for empathy. My sister has her own beliefs, which I think is a good thing. In fact, if I immigrated to Northern Europe one day, I would also convert to Christianity. Sister, one day I will accompany you to the place you want to go, with you to purify our souls. Sister, your gentleness is your biggest advantage, I like it very much, also very grateful.<br>
    Sister, I always wanted to rest in hospital for a while in the past time. Away from school, away from the crowd, quiet rest for a while. The hospital was quiet and beautiful to me, and the bustling sounds around gave me a hazy feeling, like an old man watching young children play games. But now that I&rsquo;ve got the chance, I don&rsquo;t want to stay here. I can&rsquo;t wait to go out and meet you. The hospital is quiet, but because of you, I don&rsquo;t want to be so quiet. When I see the beautiful scenery outside the ward, when I see you a person in the empty classroom, I hate why I have no ability to accompany you. On the one hand, I am afraid that you will forget me. I am afraid that over time, your feelings for me will become weak. I am afraid that other people will appear. You know, I don&rsquo;t know how long it will take to meet someone like my sister when I miss the next one. So I want to hold you tight. On the other hand, it may not be painful for you to be alone. But for me, loneliness has been eroding my heart in the past time, so I am afraid of loneliness, so I will not naturally feel that you will also be lonely. I wish I could spend time with you. However, I am also telling myself that you are you, I am me, you are not afraid of loneliness, you will prefer me to take medicine in the hospital, take good health before coming out. Therefore, I will still take my medicine and listen to the doctor and the school. And sister, I don&rsquo;t know if you like me to say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;. Sometimes I feel like the words come out empty, like I&rsquo;m Shouting into a cave. If my sister doesn&rsquo;t like it, I don&rsquo;t have to say.<br>
    I&rsquo;d like to end with a quote from Herman Hesse&rsquo;s novel Siddhartha: &ldquo;How beautiful and charming the world is when one is simple, awake, and unhesitatingly absorbed in walking through it.&rdquo; Sister, the exam went well, I hope we can all become better. Besides, I will keep the promise I made to my sister.<br>
    I am writing to wish you well.</p>
